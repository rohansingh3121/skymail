# `SKYmail`

In this project, we developed a full stack application, which is capable of sending scheduled mails as well as storing the mails sent before via the application. The model is developed using MERN stack. This project uses MongoDB to store the user's data, ReactJS and Material UI is used to develop the UI of the application. NodeJS to connect the backend with frontend.

> The web app firstly makes you sign up for it, if you are not a registered user. A user can sign in his/her account with his Google Account. On entering the account, the user can see all his scheduled mails, i.e. the mails which are to be send on a specified date and time.

The home screen contains 3 buttons :-
- **Home Button** - To go to the page where you can see all the scheduled mails.
- **Compose Button** - Here you can compose/create new emails and send it simultaneously or schedule it for later.
- **History Button** - This is the place where user can see all the mails which have been sent by him/her earlier.

We have developed a responsive, user friendly UI which is very easy to use and understand. The information regarding mails are shown in tables which will help users to navigate through mails easily.
